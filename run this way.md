The error you're encountering is related to compatibility issues between the Python version you're using and some of the dependencies. It seems that you're using Python 3.12, which might not be fully compatible with some of the older packages in the project.

Here's what we can try to resolve this issue:

1. First, let's check the Python version specified in the Pipfile:

```12:13:Pipfile
[requires]
python_version = "3.10"
```

The project is configured to use Python 3.10. Let's try to use this version instead.

2. Install Python 3.10 if you haven't already.

3. Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.10:

```
python3.10 -m venv venv310
```

4. Activate the new virtual environment:

```
venv310\Scripts\activate
```

5. Install pipenv in this new environment:

```
pip install pipenv
```

6. Now, try to install the dependencies again:

```
pipenv install --dev
```

If you still encounter issues, we might need to update some of the project's dependencies. Here's an alternative approach:

1. Delete the existing Pipfile.lock file.

2. Update the Pipfile to use more recent versions of the packages. Open the Pipfile and modify it as follows:

```
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
opencv-python = "*"
psutil = "*"
numpy = "*"

[dev-packages]

[requires]
python_version = "3.10"
```

3. Run the installation command again:

```
pipenv install --dev
```

This should create a new Pipfile.lock with updated, compatible versions of the packages.

If you're still facing issues, please let me know, and we can try other approaches or investigate further.
